abstract = "Nowcasting for hydrological applications is discussed. The tracking algorithm extrapolates radar images in space and time. It originates from the pattern recognition techniques TREC (Tracking Radar Echoes by Correlation, Rinehart and Garvey, J. Appl. Meteor., 34 (1995) 1286) and COTREC (Continuity of TREC vectors, Li et al., Nature, 273 (1978) 287). To evaluate the quality of the extrapolation, a parameter scheme is introduced, able to distinguish between errors in the position and the intensity of the predicted precipitation. The parameters for the position are the absolute error, the relative error and the error of the forecasted direction. The parameters for the intensity are the ratio of the medians and the variations of the rain rate (ratio of two quantiles) between the actual and the forecasted image. To judge the overall quality of the forecast, the correlation coefficient between the forecasted and the actual radar image has been used. To improve the forecast, three aspects have been investigated: (a) Common meteorological attributes of convective cells, derived from a hail statistics, have been determined to optimize the parameters of the tracking algorithm. Using (a), the forecast procedure modifications (b) and (c) have been applied. (b) Small-scale features have been removed by using larger tracking areas and by applying a spatial and temporal smoothing, since problems with the tracking algorithm are mainly caused by small-scale/short-term variations of the echo pattern or because of limitations caused by the radar technique itself (erroneous vectors caused by clutter or shielding). (c) The searching area and the number of searched boxes have been restricted. This limits false detections, which is especially useful in stratiform precipitation and for stationary echoes. Whereas a larger scale and the removal of small-scale features improve the forecasted position for the convective precipitation, the forecast of the stratiform event is not influenced, but limiting the search area leads to a slightly better forecast. The forecast of the intensity is successful for both precipitation events. Forecasting the variation of the rain rate calls for further investigation. Applying COTREC improves the forecast of the convective precipitation, especially for extrapolation times exceeding 30min."
